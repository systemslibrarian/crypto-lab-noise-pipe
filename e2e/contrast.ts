/**
 * Composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 contrast measurement.
 *
 * This exists because axe is not a complete contrast oracle. Two classes of
 * text never reach the `violations` array a gate asserts on:
 *
 *  - text over a surface axe declines to resolve — a gradient, an `rgba()` over
 *    an unknown backdrop, or a `color-mix()`. This lab's own stylesheet paints
 *    flat custom-property hex colours (`--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`,
 *    `--bg-card`, …) and no gradients at all, so most of the page IS within
 *    axe's reach — but not all of it. The shared top bar is `color-mix()`
 *    throughout: its ink (`--cl-ink` mixes the accent toward near-white), its
 *    border, and the `.cl-btn:hover` fill are all mixes axe files under
 *    `incomplete`. And the "changed" highlight on a party-state row
 *    (`.state-row.state-changed`) is an `rgba(63, 185, 80, …)` tint over the
 *    card surface — a translucent colour axe declines to composite, sitting
 *    under the `.state-val` hex text and the `.gl` glossary links, which is
 *    exactly where an earlier hand pass here found sub-AA ratios.
 *  - text faded by an ancestor's `opacity` — axe reads the declared `color`,
 *    which is not the colour that lands on screen. This lab has real ones:
 *    `.state-row.state-absent { opacity: .45 }` is every "not held" key slot in
 *    the party-state cards — load-bearing teaching state, since which keys a
 *    party does NOT hold is half of what a pattern teaches —
 *    `.packet-bytes { opacity: .75 }` and `.wire-block-bytes { opacity: .85 }`
 *    are the byte counts on the packet diagrams, and `.cl-hero-sub` sits at
 *    `.85`. The `.btn:disabled { opacity: .5 }` case is exempt (inactive
 *    control) and the walk honours that below.
 *
 * So: walk every element that owns text, composite the real painted result
 * (translucent colours, gradient stops and opacity groups included), and
 * compute the ratio against the surface the text is genuinely sitting on
 * rather than against white. A gradient is judged at the text's own location.
 *
 * Opacity is modelled the way the compositor actually does it: an element with
 * `opacity < 1` renders its subtree into a group, then composites the group
 * over the backdrop. That means the *text* and the *background beside it* fade
 * onto the same backdrop independently — which is why both are carried through
 * the walk as a pair rather than fading the foreground alone.
 * `.state-row.state-changed` is exactly the shape the pair models: the row's
 * own `rgba()` tint and its text both sit inside the `.state-absent`-style
 * opacity group when a row is both changed and faded, and the ink lands on the
 * `.party-card` surface showing through.
 *
 * The ancestor walk is geometry-aware, because DOM ancestry is not the same
 * thing as "painted underneath". An absolutely positioned child can render
 * entirely outside its parent's box, and then the parent's background is simply
 * not behind it. So an ancestor's own paint is applied only when its border box
 * actually intersects the text's box; a partial intersection still counts, so
 * the judgement stays worst-case. Opacity is unconditional either way — an
 * opacity group fades its whole subtree wherever that subtree happens to paint.
 *
 * Three things this lab forced on top of that, each of which otherwise makes
 * the helper report a ratio nothing on screen has:
 *
 *  - TEXT SCROLLED OUT OF A CLIPPING ANCESTOR PAINTS NOTHING. Here the clipping
 *    boxes are `.panel-nav` (the tab strip, `overflow-x: auto`),
 *    `.pattern-display` (`white-space: pre; overflow-x: auto` around every
 *    message-sequence listing), `.comparison-container` (the comparison table's
 *    scroller at phone width), `#wire-blocks` (the per-message byte blocks) and
 *    every `.hex-value`/`.hex-output`. Content scrolled past any of them is not
 *    dimmed or partly drawn — it is absent, and asking what colour it sits on
 *    has no answer. Its rect is outside every ancestor's box, so the ancestor
 *    walk would find nothing behind it and fall through to white, inventing a
 *    failure. Skip it, and rely on the content that IS in view, which is
 *    measured for real.
 *
 *  - TRANSPARENT TEXT PAINTS NOTHING. Anything drawn `color: transparent` lays
 *    no ink down; compositing a zero-alpha foreground just returns the backdrop
 *    and reports a fixed 1:1. There is no contrast requirement on ink that is
 *    never laid down.
 *
 *  - SVG PAINTS IN DOCUMENT ORDER, SO SIBLINGS CAN BE THE BACKGROUND. Unlike
 *    most labs in this fleet, this branch is LIVE here: the walkthrough's
 *    message-lane diagram is a real inline `<svg>` with three `<text>` runs —
 *    the two party names (`.diagram-party`), the token list
 *    (`.diagram-tokens`) and the byte-count line (`.diagram-size`, filled with
 *    `--text-muted`) — drawn after stroke-only `<line>` lifelines and a
 *    `fill: currentColor` arrowhead `<path>`. The FILLED-shapes-only guard in
 *    `svgUnderlay` matters for exactly those lifelines: SVG's initial `fill` is
 *    black and `getComputedStyle` reports it for stroke-only geometry too, so
 *    without the guard a dashed lifeline would read as an opaque black
 *    rectangle behind the party labels and fabricate a failure. No sibling
 *    shape actually contains the text boxes, so the labels correctly composite
 *    onto the panel behind the `<svg>`'s transparent background.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS WALK CANNOT SEE, stated so they are not mistaken for coverage.
 *
 * GENERATED CONTENT. The walk iterates ELEMENTS, and a `::before`/`::after` is
 * not one — nor is it one to axe's `color-contrast` rule. This lab's stylesheet
 * declares no `content:` of its own (the only `::before`/`::after` selector is
 * the box-sizing reset), so today this gap is empty here — its non-colour cues
 * are real glyph characters in the markup (the ✅/⚠/— badge glyphs, the 🔒/🔓
 * on wire blocks, the ⊘/→/⇄/◐/● security icons), which ARE text nodes and ARE
 * walked. `nontext.ts` still audits pseudo-content at every driven state, so
 * the first decorative `content:` rule someone adds is gated from the moment
 * it lands rather than joining a blind spot.
 *
 * PLACEHOLDER INK. The two transport plaintext inputs ship with a
 * `placeholder="Type a message…"`. A placeholder is not a text node, so the
 * walk cannot see it — and axe's `color-contrast` rule skips placeholders as
 * well. That is a shared blind spot of both oracles, stated here rather than
 * assumed covered; the drive types into both inputs, so every asserted state
 * beyond arrival measures real user text in those boxes.

/**
 * `within` narrows the walk to one subtree.

 * The default is the whole page, and that is what every `scan` in this lab
 * uses. Nothing here is short-lived enough to need the narrowed form: this
 * lab's motion is four CSS animations (`fadeSlideIn` on log entries,
 * `drawArrow` on the diagram arrow, `stateHighlight` on changed state rows,
 * and the anatomy keys' `slideFromLeft`/`slideFromRight`), every one of which
 * is cancelled under the reduced motion this gate asserts — three by explicit
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` blocks and the anatomy pair by being gated
 * behind `no-preference` — and `ui.ts` additionally reads `matchMedia` itself
 * to skip the `animate-in`/`diagram-animate` classes and the slide re-trigger.
 * Every scanned state is therefore already at rest. The one animated repaint
 * left is the copy button's transient "✓" (an 800ms `setTimeout`, no CSS
 * animation), and the drive does not assert during it.
 *
 * The parameter is kept because the narrowed form is what makes a short-lived
 * state measurable at all: a class that lives 500ms is shorter than a full axe
 * pass, so a whole-page scan would catch it only sometimes, and a
 * sometimes-measured assertion is worse than none.

     * parent whose border box does not overlap the text paints nothing behind
     * it. Applied to the ROOT it is wrong, and wrong in the direction that
     * FABRICATES failures. CSS propagates the root element's background to the
     * canvas and paints it over the whole canvas regardless of the root's own
     * box (CSS Backgrounds 3, "The Canvas Background"); if the root's own
     * background is transparent the value is taken from `<body>` instead.
     *
     * The failure this prevents is not hypothetical — it cost a run elsewhere in
     * this fleet. A lab that sets `html, body { height: 100% }` has both boxes
     * exactly one viewport tall while the document runs several viewports long,
     * so every element below the fold intersects neither, the walk ends with a
     * transparent backdrop, and it falls through to WHITE. In a dark theme that
     * reports muted footer text against a white page that does not exist — 34 of
     * 38 findings in one run elsewhere in this fleet — and it can mask a real
     * failure in the other direction just as easily.
     *
     * This page is on the SAFE side of that failure, and deliberately so:
     * `styles/main.css` gives `html` its own flat `background-color:
     * var(--bg-primary)` — with a comment saying it is there precisely so the
     * canvas is painted by the root — and `<body>` repeats it with only
     * `min-height: 100vh`. So the rule below resolves the root's paint on the
     * first try and the WHITE fallback stays unreachable. It is kept as the
     * fleet-shared shape because it is what makes that safety a measured
     * property rather than a hope: delete the `html` background and this walk
     * would judge everything below the first viewport against white in dark
